# Spotify Annotator
A tool for adding notes into your Spotify playlist. [Here you go.](https://IFcoltransG.github.io/spotify-annotator)

## Why might I use this?
Spotify gives you a playlist description to edit, but it's too limiting. It's short and has to explain your whole playlist, rather than letting you comment on specific parts of your list. That's where Spotify Annotator come in. You can add custom notes anywhere in a playlist, in the form of greyed-out songs. Spotify will think they're local songs that it doesn't have, and will automatically skip them. There are no downsides!

## How does this work?
Make yourself an unannotated playlist, and select all of the songs in it. (Only on desktop, sorry!) If you click [this link](https://IFcoltransG.github.io/spotify-annotator), you'll see a box, into which you can copy and paste the selected songs. You'll see some inscrutable links on the right, and on the left some pretty album artwork for all of the songs. You'll also see `Insert` buttons underneath each. Double-clicking one of these buttons will add a new song among the inscrutable links, except it will be for a 'local' song. (This is a lie, but Spotify doesn't need to know that.)

Spotify trusts the names, albums and artists of any local song, so you're free to edit those to whatever you want. Even if Spotify thinks it's a song name, any human coming along will know what it really is: a message from you! When you've added notes at crucial points, simply copy and paste the inscrutable links back into a Spotify playlist.

Everything *should* unfold smoothly, but every so often Spotify crashes at that point. Fear not! Just reopen Spotify and try again.

## How will this look?
